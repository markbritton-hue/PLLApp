# PowerLift Live — User & Coach Guide

> **Disclaimer:** PowerLift Live (PLL App) is an unofficial, independent tool and is **not the official scoring app** for any competition. It is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by the Michigan High School Powerlifting Association (MHSPL)**. For official results, always refer to the meet director or official MHSPL resources.

---

**PowerLift Live** is a free web app that lets coaches, athletes, and families follow a powerlifting meet in real time — right from their phone or any browser. No app download needed.

---

## How to Open the App

Open your browser and go to the URL your meet coordinator shared (it will look something like `https://yourschool.github.io/PLLApp`). Bookmark it so you can get back to it quickly.

That's it. No login, no account, no download.

## For Families & Fans

### What can I see?

Once the meet is running, tap **All Results** from the home screen. You'll see every athlete in the meet organized by weight class with their place ranking and total weight lifted.

Your school's athletes will be **highlighted in green** so they're easy to find.

### What do the numbers mean?

Each athlete has three lifts: **Squat**, **Bench Press**, and **Deadlift**. They get three attempts at each. The best successful attempt from each lift adds up to their **Total**.

- **Green attempt** = good lift ✓
- **Red attempt** = failed lift ✗
- **Total** = their score for the meet

Athletes are ranked within their weight class by total — highest total wins.

### Can I see my athlete's attempts as they happen?

Yes — tap **All Results** and turn on **Auto-Refresh**. The page will update automatically every 20 seconds so you always see the latest numbers.

## For Coaches

As a coach, you have access to several views depending on what you need.

---

### Coaches View — Your Most Important Tool

**Coaches View** is designed specifically for coaches on the meet floor. It shows **only your athletes** across every platform, filtered to the ones who are coming up soon.

Each athlete card tells you:
- Which **platform** they're on
- Their **position** in the lifting order (Lifting, On Deck, Position 3, etc.)
- Their current **attempt weight**
- Their squat, bench, and deadlift progress so far

**How to use it on meet day:**
1. Open the app on your phone and tap **Coaches View**
2. Tap **Auto-Refresh: OFF** to turn auto-refresh on (button turns green)
3. Keep the screen on — it will update automatically
4. When an athlete finishes a lift, their card will update with the result within a few seconds

> The app remembers whether auto-refresh was on or off, so if you accidentally close the tab and reopen it, it picks up where it left off.

---

### Team Athletes — Full Roster View

Tap **Team Athletes** to see your entire varsity and JV roster organized by weight class. Each athlete's card shows:
- Body weight
- All three attempts per lift as they happen
- Running total
- Which platform they're assigned to (shown as a purple badge)

This is useful for reviewing your team's performance after a flight or at the end of the meet.

---

### Platform View — Watch a Single Platform

If you're standing at a specific platform, tap **Platform View** and select that platform number. You'll see the full lifting order for that platform — who just lifted, who's up now, and who's next.

---

### Team Standings — Where Does Your School Rank?

Tap **Team Standings** to see how all the schools are stacking up in total team points. Your school is shown along with all other competing schools, sorted by total points.

Turn on auto-refresh here too if you want it to update throughout the meet.

---

### All Results — Full Meet Results

Tap **All Results** for a complete view of every athlete in the meet, grouped by weight class. Athletes are ranked within their class (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) by their total weight lifted.

Your school's athletes are highlighted in green so they stand out.

---

## Quick Tips for Meet Day

- **Coaches View + Auto-Refresh on** = your phone becomes a real-time tracker for all your athletes at once
- If the page stops updating, check your phone's wifi or cell signal — the app needs internet to refresh data
- All pages work on phones, tablets, and laptops
- You can have multiple pages open in different browser tabs — for example, Coaches View on one tab and Team Standings on another
- The app does not require a login and works for anyone who has the link — share it freely with parents and athletes

## Something Looks Wrong?

If data looks outdated or missing, try:
1. Tapping the **Auto-Refresh** button to force a refresh
2. Reloading the page
3. Asking the meet coordinator to check that the Google Sheet is still shared and being updated by the scoring software
